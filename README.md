# Modl.go

The go implementation of [Modl](https://www.modl.uk/).

Targeting a similar interface to [encoding/json](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) (where possible).

Given the ability for modl to load remote files, I may wait to publish this until [golang's proposal of `fs.FS`](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-iofs.md) has been released.
